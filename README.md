# AI-Based Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a web-based **AI Fraud Detection System** designed to identify suspicious banking transactions in real time.  
It uses **Machine Learning techniques** to analyze transaction behavior and assign a **risk score**, helping banks detect fraud early and reduce financial loss.

---

## 🔹 Problem Statement
Banking systems today face increasing fraud such as:
- Unauthorized transactions  
- Abnormal spending behavior  
- Account misuse  

Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems fail because fraud patterns continuously evolve.  
Manual monitoring is slow and often detects fraud **after damage has already occurred**.

---

## 🔹 Proposed Solution
This system uses **Machine Learning integrated with a web application** to:
- Analyze transactions instantly  
- Detect abnormal patterns  
- Assign fraud risk levels  
- Store transaction history  
- Provide analytical insights  

---

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python, Django  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, Isolation Forest  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  

---

## 🔹 System Working
1. User enters transaction details (amount, type, time)
2. Input is processed by trained ML models
3. A fraud risk score is calculated
4. Transaction is classified as **Safe** or **Fraud**
5. Result is displayed to the user
6. Transaction data is stored for analysis

---

## 🔹 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Random Forest:** Identifies known fraud patterns based on historical data  
- **Isolation Forest:** Detects unusual or abnormal transaction behavior  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both models for better fraud detection accuracy  

---

## 🔹 Dataset Information
The system was trained using a real-world **bank transaction fraud dataset**.  
Due to large file size, datasets and trained model files are **used locally** and not uploaded to GitHub.  
This follows standard industry practices.

---

## 🔹 Features
- Real-time fraud prediction  
- Risk score generation  
- Transaction history tracking  
- Analytics dashboard  
- Simple and user-friendly interface  

---

## 🔹 Domain
**Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (FinTech)**

---

## 🔹 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how AI can be effectively used in banking systems to detect fraud early and improve security.  
It serves as a **TRL-5 validated prototype** and can be extended for real-world deployment with additional data and features.
